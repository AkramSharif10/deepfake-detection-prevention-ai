Deepfake Detection and Prevention
Project Overview
Welcome to this Deepfake Detection and Prevention project. This project uses advanced AI techniques to identify and mitigate the impact of manipulated images. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and neural networks, this project aims to effectively distinguish between real and deepfake images. It offers a valuable tool for researchers, developers, and anyone interested in AI's role in combating digital misinformation.

How It Works
The application provides a user-friendly interface to analyze images. When an image is uploaded, the model processes it to determine if it is authentic or a deepfake.

The model will then display its prediction, labeling the image as either "Real" or "Fake" and providing a brief explanation for its conclusion.
